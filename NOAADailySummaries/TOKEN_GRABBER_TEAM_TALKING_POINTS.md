# Token Grabber Team Talking Points

## Quick 2-minute walkthrough (not too scripted)

Use this as a loose flow, not a word-for-word script:

- Start with intent:
  - "This script pulls NOAA daily summaries and saves local JSON snapshots we can trust and reuse."

- Show one run command:
  - `NOAA_TOKEN="your_token_here" python tokengrabber.py`

- Call out what changed:
  - Missing token now gives fix instructions instead of a confusing crash.
  - HTTP/network failures now explain likely cause.

- Point to outputs:
  - Files land in `data/daily_summaries/`.
  - Naming pattern includes location/date/page.

- Connect to downstream value:
  - "These JSON snapshots feed DataFrame loading, notebook analysis, and API views."

- End with one practical takeaway:
  - "If this script works, the rest of the data workflow becomes much easier to debug and demo."

## Engineer-focused walkthrough (explicit)

Use this version when speaking to engineers who want implementation detail.

### 1) Entry points and token flow

- Script entrypoint: `main()` in `tokengrabber.py`.
- Token resolution path:
  1) `NOAA_TOKEN` from environment,
  2) interactive prompt in TTY,
  3) explicit setup instructions then `ValueError`.

Engineering intent:
- deterministic behavior in CI/non-interactive runs,
- user-friendly behavior in local interactive runs.

### 2) Request construction and paging

- Core loop builds URL with NOAA params + `offset` + `limit`.
- Request uses stdlib `urllib.request.Request` + header `token`.
- Stop condition: `len(results) < limit` or empty results.

Engineering intent:
- avoid third-party HTTP dependency,
- avoid silent truncation of multi-page datasets,
- keep paging logic transparent.

### 3) Persistence model

- Each response page is written as a full JSON payload.
- Naming format includes location/date/page index.

Engineering intent:
- preserve immutable-ish source snapshots,
- allow reprocessing without re-hitting external API,
- support incident/debug replay from captured payloads.

### 4) Error handling strategy

- `HTTPError`:
  - special guidance for `401/403` (token/auth issue),
  - re-raises for visibility in logs/CI.
- `URLError`:
  - network reachability hint,
  - re-raises to preserve fail-fast semantics.

Engineering intent:
- human-readable diagnosis + machine-visible failure signal.

### 5) System integration contracts

- Producer contract:
  - emits JSON files under `data/daily_summaries`.
- Consumer contracts:
  - `json_helper.py` parses payload `results` into DataFrame rows,
  - notebooks and APIs consume DataFrame output.

Pipeline contract:
- API response -> JSON snapshots -> DataFrame -> analysis/API.

### 6) Verification checklist (engineering)

Run these checks during demo/review:

```bash
# 1) Missing token UX
env -u NOAA_TOKEN python tokengrabber.py

# 2) Happy path fetch
NOAA_TOKEN="your_token_here" python tokengrabber.py

# 3) DataFrame build
python build_daily_summaries_df.py

# 4) README compliance
python readme_requirements_check.py
```

Expected outcomes:
- missing-token path prints remediation commands,
- happy path writes JSON files,
- downstream DataFrame build succeeds,
- requirements check reports PASS.

### 7) Engineering tradeoffs (talk track)

- Why stdlib over `requests`:
  - fewer env mismatches/module errors,
  - lower setup cost for learners.
- Why file snapshots over direct in-memory only:
  - stronger auditability and reproducibility.
- Why separate `*_basic.py` and advanced files:
  - preserves assignment-safe path while enabling scalable architecture.

## 1) What this script does

- Script: `tokengrabber.py`
- Purpose: fetch NOAA Daily Summaries data and save each API page as local JSON.
- Output folder: `data/daily_summaries/`
- Output pattern: `daily_summaries_<location>_<start>_<end>_<page>.json`

Key business value:
- We create reproducible, inspectable source snapshots before analysis/API layers.

---

## 2) Why we built it this way

- Uses Python stdlib HTTP (`urllib`) instead of `requests`.
  - Less environment friction.
  - Fewer external dependencies to break.

- Uses pagination (`offset`, `limit`) in a loop.
  - Handles datasets larger than one page automatically.

- Saves every response page.
  - Easier debugging and data lineage.
  - Downstream loaders can rerun without calling NOAA again.

---

## 3) Token handling improvement (what changed)

Previous behavior:
- Missing token raised an error with minimal guidance.

Current behavior:
- If `NOAA_TOKEN` is missing, the script now:
  1) tells user exactly what is wrong,
  2) prints copy/paste fix commands,
  3) supports interactive token paste in TTY sessions.

Why this matters:
- Reduces onboarding friction.
- Makes failures self-healing for users.

---

## 4) Error handling improvement (what changed)

- Better HTTP error messaging:
  - `401/403` -> token likely invalid/missing/unauthorized.
- Better network error messaging:
  - prompts user to check connectivity/API reachability.

Why this matters:
- Faster diagnosis.
- Fewer support pings for common setup mistakes.

---

## 5) How to run (demo commands)

One-time token run:
```bash
NOAA_TOKEN="your_token_here" python tokengrabber.py
```

Session-based token run:
```bash
export NOAA_TOKEN="your_token_here"
python tokengrabber.py
```

Persist token in zsh:
```bash
echo 'export NOAA_TOKEN="your_token_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## 6) What success looks like

- Script prints:
  - `✅ Data saved: <n> file(s)`
  - list of saved file paths
- JSON files appear in:
  - `data/daily_summaries/`

---

## 7) How this connects to the rest of the system

- `tokengrabber.py` produces raw JSON snapshots.
- `json_helper.py` converts those snapshots into DataFrames.
- Notebook and APIs consume DataFrames for analysis and browsing.

System pipeline:
- NOAA API -> JSON files -> DataFrame -> notebook plots / web API views

## 8) Suggested team walkthrough agenda (10 minutes)

1. Show script goal and output files (1 min)
2. Show token UX and missing-token recovery (2 min)
3. Show pagination logic and naming pattern (2 min)
4. Run script live and verify output (2 min)
5. Show downstream usage (`json_helper`, notebook/API) (2 min)
6. Q&A + next improvements (1 min)

---

## 9) Optional future improvements

- Add retries/backoff for transient HTTP failures.
- Add optional CLI args for dataset/location/date.
- Add a `--dry-run` mode that prints request URLs without writing files.
- Add structured logging for easier observability.
